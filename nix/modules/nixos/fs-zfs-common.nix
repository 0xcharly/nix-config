        The 32-bit host ID of the machine, formatted as 8 hexadecimal characters.

        You should try to make this ID unique among your machines. You can
        generate a random 32-bit ID using the following commands:

        `head -c 8 /etc/machine-id`

        (this derives it from the machine-id that systemd generates) or

        `head -c4 /dev/urandom | od -A none -t x4`

        The primary use case is to ensure when using ZFS that a pool isn't imported
        accidentally on a wrong machine.
